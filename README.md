# CheckProcessRunning
A simple C++ program to continuously check whether a process is running.

## taskkill
Press `CTRL + END` at any time, to terminate all process instances, if any are running.

You can also toggle autokill with `CTRL + F3`. Autokill automatically terminates every instance of the process, if any are running.
