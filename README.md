# CheckProcessRunning
A simple C++ program to continuously check whether a process is running.

## taskkill
Press CTRL + END at any time, to terminate all process instances, if any are running.
You can also enable autokill after entering an executable name. Autokill automatically terminates every instance of the process, if any are running.
